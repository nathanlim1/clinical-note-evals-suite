  "note_text": "Subjective:\nZack Fields reports experiencing constant pain in his right knee and left ankle for the past six months. He describes the pain as a dull ache that is always present and affects his mobility, particularly when walking or standing for extended periods. He notes that the pain improves when he is sitting or lying down. Zack has been taking ibuprofen for pain relief, but it provides only minimal relief and occasionally causes stomach discomfort.\n\nObjective:\nDuring the examination, Zack appeared uncomfortable when moving his right knee and left ankle. There were no signs of swelling or redness in the affected joints. Zack's range of motion in both joints was limited due to pain. He is currently taking ibuprofen 600mg as needed for pain relief. Zack's mother expressed concerns about his mental health due to the impact of the pain on his daily activities.\n\nAssessment:\nBased on Zack's symptoms and history, the likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis in the right knee and left ankle. Further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Zack's current pain management with ibuprofen is suboptimal, and he experiences occasional gastrointestinal side effects. Referral to physical therapy is recommended to improve mobility and reduce strain on the affected joints.\n\nPlan:\n1. Prescribe a different medication for pain management that may be more effective and have fewer gastrointestinal side effects.\n2. Refer Zack to physical therapy to address mobility issues and strengthen the affected joints.\n3. Advise Zack to avoid heavy lifting or bending and to take it easy on his joints.\n4. Follow up with Zack in a few weeks to assess his progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed."

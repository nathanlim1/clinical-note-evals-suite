It's been going on for a few weeks now, and I thought it was time to get it checked out.\n\nPhysician: I see. Can you tell me more about the pain? Is it sharp, dull, or achy? Does it radiate to other areas, or is it localized in the joints?\n\nPatient: It's a dull ache, mostly in my knees and hips. Sometimes it feels like my joints are grinding against each other. It doesn't really radiate anywhere else, just in the joints themselves.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in the affected joints?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like that. Just the pain and stiffness, especially when I wake up in the morning or after I've been sitting for a while.\n\nPhysician: Okay. How long have you been experiencing this joint pain?\n\nPatient: Like I said, it's been a few weeks now. It started gradually, but it's been getting worse over time.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you recently experienced any changes in your work or daily activities that might be contributing to the pain?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been working at a desk job for the past few years, and I've noticed that I've been getting more tired and experiencing more pain in my joints at the end of the day.\n\nPhysician: That's helpful information. Have you tried any treatments or remedies for the pain, such as over-the-counter medications or physical therapy?\n\nPatient: I've been taking some acetaminophen when the pain gets really bad, but that's about it. I haven't tried anything else yet.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, chills, or loss of appetite?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like that.

He notes no swelling, redness, or warmth in the affected joints. The pain has been ongoing for a few weeks and has been gradually worsening. Mr. Baker attributes the pain to his desk job and reports taking acetaminophen for symptom relief.\n\nObjective:\nDuring the examination, Mr. Baker displayed no signs of swelling, redness, or warmth in the knees and hips.

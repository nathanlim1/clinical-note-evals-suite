I've had a persistent cough and my chest feels heavy and congested.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you experienced any shortness of breath or fever?\n\nPatient: No, not really. Just a lot of mucus and coughing.\n\nPhysician: Okay. Have you noticed any triggers that make your symptoms worse, such as exposure to allergens or certain environments?\n\nPatient: Well, I have been noticing that my symptoms tend to worsen at night, and I've been using my albuterol inhaler more frequently than usual.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you recently traveled or been exposed to anyone with similar symptoms?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't traveled recently, and I don't think anyone in my household has been sick.\n\nPhysician: Okay. Let's talk about your medical history. You have asthma and allergic rhinitis. Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been managing those conditions?\n\nPatient: Sure. I use my albuterol inhaler as needed, and I take fluticasone daily to control my asthma. For my allergic rhinitis, I take loratadine every morning.\n\nPhysician: That's great. Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms or medication effectiveness recently?\n\nPatient: Well, like I mentioned, I've been using my albuterol inhaler more often lately, but other than that, my symptoms have been pretty well-controlled.\n\nPhysician: I see.

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nWillard Craig reports feeling crummy for the past few days with a persistent cough and a heavy, congested chest. He mentions using his albuterol inhaler more frequently than usual and experiencing wheezing, especially at night. No fever or shortness of breath reported. Denies recent travel or exposure to sick individuals.\n\nObjective:\nPatient appears alert and cooperative during the examination. No signs of respiratory distress observed. Lung auscultation reveals wheezing in bilateral lung fields. Peak flow meter readings to be assessed. Chest X-ray and nasal swab ordered to rule out pneumonia and viral infections, respectively.\n\nAssessment:\nLikely exacerbation of asthma and allergic rhinitis due to a possible viral infection. Increased use of albuterol inhaler and wheezing indicate compromised respiratory function. Treatment plan includes increasing fluticasone dose, adding prednisone for inflammation, and providing nebulizer treatment for airway opening. Follow-up appointment scheduled for next week to review test results and adjust treatment as needed.\n\nPlan:\n1. Order chest X-ray and nasal swab.\n2. Assess peak flow meter readings.\n3. Increase fluticasone dose to twice daily.\n4. Prescribe short course of prednisone.\n5. Provide nebulizer treatment for airway opening.\n6. Schedule follow-up appointment for next week to review test results and adjust treatment plan as needed."

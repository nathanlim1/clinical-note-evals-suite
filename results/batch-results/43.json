  "note_text": "Subjective:\nWarren reports experiencing worsening symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting over the past few months. He notes that the symptoms started around three months ago and have become more persistent and frequent. Warren mentions that dairy and spicy foods seem to exacerbate his symptoms, and he has been under increased stress due to a recent job change. He has also observed some blood in his stool and has experienced weight loss.\n\nObjective:\nWarren appears anxious but cooperative during the consultation. He denies fever, chills, fatigue, weakness, or difficulty swallowing. His medical history includes a diagnosis of GERD three years ago, for which he has been taking Omeprazole. Warren mentions that his father has a history of gastrointestinal issues, including GERD and irritable bowel syndrome. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, and vital signs are within normal limits.\n\nAssessment:\nWarren presents with chronic symptoms of GERD, including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Given his family history of gastrointestinal issues and the presence of blood in his stool, further investigation is warranted to rule out potential underlying causes. A colonoscopy and blood tests have been ordered to assess for possible infections, inflammation, or other contributing factors.\n\nPlan:\nWarren will undergo a colonoscopy to evaluate his colon and investigate any potential abnormalities. Blood tests will be conducted to assess for infections and inflammation. In the interim, Warren is advised to avoid trigger foods and manage stress levels. Follow-up will occur once the test results are available to determine the next steps in his treatment plan. Warren expresses gratitude for the physician's attention and assistance in addressing his health concerns."

When did they start, and how often do you get them?\n\nPatient: They started about six weeks ago, and I've been getting them almost every day since then. It's like a constant throbbing pain in the back of my head, sometimes it's accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you noticed any triggers that make the headaches worse or better?\n\nPatient: Well, I've noticed that they seem to get worse when I'm under stress or haven't slept well. Sometimes, bending down or coughing can make them worse too.\n\nPhysician: That's helpful information. Have you experienced any other symptoms aside from the headaches?\n\nPatient: Yes, my blood pressure has been a bit high lately, and my cholesterol levels have always been a bit elevated.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, such as blurry vision, double vision, or loss of vision?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like that. Just the headaches and occasional nausea.\n\nPhysician: Okay.

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nMr. Cook reports experiencing constant throbbing headaches for the past six weeks, often accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light. He notes that stress and lack of sleep seem to exacerbate the headaches. Additionally, he mentions elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels as other health concerns.\n\nObjective:\nDuring the examination, Mr. Cook appeared uncomfortable due to his headaches but was cooperative and engaged in the conversation. No signs of acute distress were noted. His blood pressure was slightly elevated, and his cholesterol levels were within the elevated range. Mr. Cook's overall demeanor was calm and receptive to the physician's recommendations.\n\nAssessment:\nBased on Mr. Cook's symptoms and history, it is likely that he is experiencing migraines. Further evaluation and testing will be necessary to confirm this diagnosis. The plan includes starting Mr. Cook on a medication regimen to prevent migraines and referring him to a neurologist for additional assessment and management.\n\nPlan:\n1. Initiate medication for migraine prevention.\n2. Refer Mr. Cook to a neurologist for further evaluation.\n3. Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n4. Educate Mr. Cook on relaxation techniques and stress management strategies to help alleviate migraine symptoms.\n5. Encourage Mr. Cook to maintain regular communication with the care team and report any changes or concerns promptly."

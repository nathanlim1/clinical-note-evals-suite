  "note_text": "Subjective:\nMr. Hanson reports experiencing occipital and throbbing headaches that last 3-4 hours and occur 2-3 times per week. He mentions sensitivity to light during these episodes and feeling more tired than usual recently. He has tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen for relief but with limited success.\n\nObjective:\nMr. Hanson presents as alert and oriented during the consultation. He appears fatigued but otherwise in good spirits. No signs of distress or acute pain are noted. Vital signs are within normal limits. Lab tests have been ordered to investigate underlying causes of the headaches.\n\nAssessment:\nMr. Hanson's headaches are likely tension-type headaches based on the description provided.

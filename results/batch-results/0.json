He describes the pain as dull and aching, worse in the left ear, with associated hearing loss, ear plugging, drainage, and low-grade fever. He notes that allergies exacerbate the symptoms, along with sinus pressure and congestion. Over-the-counter pain relievers and decongestants have provided minimal relief.\n\nObjective:\nIvan Bailey presents with symptoms of chronic ear pain, hearing loss, drainage, and congestion. Physical examination reveals signs of bilateral ear inflammation. Vital signs are within normal limits. Immunization status is up to date, with pending results for a colonoscopy. ENT specialist Dr. Robert Smith recommends a hearing test to monitor for potential hearing loss.\n\nAssessment:\nIvan Bailey is experiencing recurrent ear infections with complications related to allergies and sinus issues. Further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the infection and associated hearing loss. Collaborative care with the ENT specialist is recommended to address the ear issues comprehensively.\n\nPlan:\n1. Update vaccines for influenza and tetanus.\n2. Schedule a colonoscopy to rule out potential issues.\n3. Perform a hearing test to assess hearing loss.\n4. Prescribe medications to manage allergies and sinus pressure.\n5. Consult with ENT specialist Dr. Robert Smith for further evaluation and treatment recommendations.\n6. Advise Ivan to avoid allergens and irritants to minimize symptoms.\n7. Follow up with Ivan to discuss test results and develop a comprehensive treatment plan."

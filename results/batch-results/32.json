And actually, I have been having some trouble swallowing too. It feels like food gets stuck in my throat.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Let's take a closer look at your respiratory system. Can you tell me about your asthma? When were you diagnosed, and how have you been managing it?\n\nPatient: I was diagnosed with asthma when I was a kid. I've been using an inhaler ever since, but lately, I've had to use it more often than usual. I've also noticed that my symptoms have been getting worse at night, which is why I've been having trouble sleeping.\n\nPhysician: That's helpful information. Have you noticed any triggers that make your asthma worse, such as allergies or environmental factors?\n\nPatient: Well, I've noticed that my symptoms tend to flare up when I'm around dust or pollen. And I've also been under a lot of stress lately, which I've read can exacerbate asthma.\n\nPhysician: Absolutely. Stress can definitely impact asthma symptoms. Have you experienced any GERD symptoms, such as heartburn or regurgitation, in addition to your asthma?\n\nPatient: Yes, actually. I've been getting heartburn pretty frequently, especially at night. It's been waking me up and making it hard to fall back asleep.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms that might be related to GERD, such as difficulty swallowing or a sour taste in the back of your throat?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've had both of those symptoms, especially in the mornings. It's like there's a lump in my throat that I can't get rid of.\n\nPhysician: Okay, that's helpful. Let's move on to your nail fungus. Can you tell me a bit more about that?

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nCrystal Arnold reports feeling unwell lately, experiencing a persistent cough, tightness in her chest, sharp chest pains, low-grade fever, fatigue, and difficulty swallowing. She notes an increase in asthma symptoms, particularly at night, despite using her inhaler regularly. Additionally, she mentions frequent heartburn, regurgitation, difficulty swallowing, and a sour taste in her throat related to GERD. Crystal also discloses a nail fungus issue that has spread over a few months and abdominal pain that has been present on and off for a few weeks, expressing concern due to her family history of colon cancer.\n\nObjective:\nDuring the examination, Crystal appears fatigued but is cooperative and engaged in the conversation. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals signs of respiratory distress, including wheezing and decreased breath sounds. No abnormalities are noted in the abdominal examination. The nail fungus is visible on multiple nails, with signs of discoloration and thickening.\n\nAssessment:\nCrystal Arnold presents with exacerbation of asthma symptoms, likely triggered by environmental factors and stress. Her GERD symptoms are prominent, impacting her sleep and daily activities. The nail fungus requires further evaluation and treatment. The abdominal pain raises concerns due to her family history of colon cancer, necessitating diagnostic tests to rule out any serious underlying conditions.\n\nPlan:\n1. Adjust asthma management plan to address nighttime symptoms and potential triggers.\n2. Initiate treatment for GERD symptoms, including lifestyle modifications and medication.\n3. Refer to a dermatologist for evaluation and management of the nail fungus.\n4. Schedule diagnostic tests, such as imaging and possibly a colonoscopy, to investigate the cause of abdominal pain and address any potential concerns related to family history.\n5.

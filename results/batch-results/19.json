  "transcript_text": "\n\nPhysician: Good morning, Kelly. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, Dr. Castillo. I've been feeling pretty miserable lately. I've had this constant heartburn that doesn't seem to go away, even when I take my medication. And I've been experiencing abdominal pain that's been getting worse over the past few weeks.\n\nPhysician: I see. Can you tell me more about your heartburn? What does it feel like? Is it a burning sensation, or is it more of a pressure?\n\nPatient: It's definitely a burning sensation, like someone poured hot water on my chest. It's worse when I lie down or bend over, and sometimes it radiates up to my throat.\n\nPhysician: Okay. And how long have you been experiencing this heartburn?\n\nPatient: It's been on and off for years, but it's been much worse lately.\n\nPhysician: I understand. And what about the abdominal pain? Can you point to where it hurts?\n\nPatient: It's mostly in my upper abdomen, around my ribcage. It's a sharp, stabbing pain that comes and goes. Sometimes it feels like someone is squeezing my stomach.\n\nPhysician: That sounds uncomfortable. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like nausea or vomiting?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've been feeling nauseous a lot lately, especially after I eat. And I've had some vomiting, mostly in the mornings.\n\nPhysician: Okay. Have you noticed any triggers that make your symptoms worse? For example, do certain foods or drinks seem to set off the heartburn or abdominal pain?\n\nPatient: Yes, definitely. Fatty or spicy foods make my heartburn worse, and I've noticed that dairy products seem to make my abdominal pain worse.\n\nPhysician: That's helpful to know. Have you had any recent changes in your diet or lifestyle that could be contributing to these symptoms?\n\nPatient: Well, my husband and I have been trying to eat healthier, so we've cut back on red meat and added more fruits and vegetables to our diet. But I haven't noticed any improvement in my symptoms.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel movements or urination patterns?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've been having some diarrhea, especially after I eat. And I've noticed that I need to urinate more frequently, especially at night.\n\nPhysician: Okay. Have you experienced any other symptoms that might be related to your gastrointestinal issues? For example, have you had any fevers, chills, or abdominal bloating?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms. Just the heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.\n\nPhysician: Okay, Kelly. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you might be experiencing some gastrointestinal issues that could be related to your GERD or IBS. I'd like to schedule you for some tests to get a better idea of what's going on. In the meantime, I'd like to recommend some lifestyle changes that might help alleviate your symptoms.\n\nPatient: Sure, what kind of tests do you have in mind?

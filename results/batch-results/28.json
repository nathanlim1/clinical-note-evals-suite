  "note_text": "Subjective:\nMrs. Stephens reports feeling under the weather with a persistent cough and tightness in her chest that has worsened over the past few days. She experiences shortness of breath and wheezing, especially with exertion. She suspects her daughter's new cat may be triggering her symptoms. Mrs. Stephens has been using her rescue inhaler more frequently but has not found relief. She also reports a low-grade fever and constant fatigue.\n\nObjective:\nMrs. Stephens presents with symptoms indicative of exacerbated asthma. Spirometry and imaging tests are planned to assess lung function and rule out other potential causes. The physician plans to prescribe a course of prednisone to reduce airway inflammation. Mrs. Stephens is advised to avoid potential triggers, such as the cat, and adhere to her current medication regimen.\n\nAssessment:\nBased on Mrs. Stephens' symptoms and history of asthma, the physician suspects an asthma exacerbation. Further testing and treatment are warranted to manage her condition effectively. Mrs. Stephens will be monitored closely for any changes in her symptoms or lung function.\n\nPlan:\n1. Order spirometry and imaging tests to evaluate lung function and rule out other causes.\n2. Prescribe a course of prednisone to reduce airway inflammation.\n3. Advise Mrs. Stephens to avoid potential triggers, such as the cat, and adhere to her current medication regimen.\n4. Schedule a follow-up appointment to review test results and adjust treatment as needed.\n5. Instruct Mrs. Stephens to seek immediate medical attention if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any shortness of breath."

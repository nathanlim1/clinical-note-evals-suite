I've been experiencing increased anxiety and depression symptoms over the past month. It's been hard to sleep at night, and I've noticed that I've been withdrawing from my family and friends more.\n\nPhysician: I see. Can you tell me more about your sleep difficulties? How many hours of sleep are you getting each night, and do you wake up feeling rested?\n\nPatient: I've been getting about 5-6 hours of sleep each night, but it's not quality sleep. I wake up feeling groggy and tired, like I haven't slept at all. And it's hard to fall asleep in the first place. My mind races with thoughts, and I can't seem to shut it off.\n\nPhysician: That sounds challenging. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or energy levels?\n\nPatient: Yes, my appetite has decreased quite a bit. I used to love cooking and trying new recipes, but lately, I just don't have the motivation or interest. And my energy levels are pretty low, too. I get winded easily, even when I'm just doing simple tasks around the house.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches, stomachaches, or muscle tension?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've had some headaches and stomachaches, especially when I'm feeling anxious. And my shoulders and back have been feeling tense all the time.\n\nPhysician: Okay, that's helpful to know. How has your mood been? Have you been experiencing any irritability, mood swings, or feelings of hopelessness?\n\nPatient: Yes, definitely. I've been feeling irritable and frustrated with myself and others. And sometimes, I just feel like I can't do anything right, like I'm a failure. It's hard to explain, but it's like there's this dark cloud hanging over me all the time.\n\nPhysician: I'm so sorry to hear that, Avery. It sounds like you're struggling with a lot right now.

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nAvery reports feeling increasingly down and experiencing heightened symptoms of anxiety and depression over the past month. She describes difficulty sleeping, with 5-6 hours of poor-quality sleep each night. Avery notes decreased appetite, low energy levels, headaches, stomachaches, and muscle tension. She also mentions feeling irritable, frustrated, and hopeless, with triggers including work stress and marital arguments. Avery acknowledges attending therapy sessions with social worker Emily Davis, finding them helpful but challenging to implement changes.\n\nObjective:\nAvery presents as a 52-year-old female with a history of anxiety disorder and depression. She appears fatigued but is cooperative and engaged during the appointment. Vital signs are within normal limits. Avery's husband has expressed concerns about her withdrawal and decreased engagement in family activities. She is compliant with her medications, including Sertraline and Lorazepam. Avery's last influenza vaccine was administered on 09/01/2022.\n\nAssessment:\nAvery is struggling with worsening symptoms of anxiety and depression, impacting her sleep, appetite, energy levels, and mood. She is facing stressors at work and home, contributing to her emotional distress. Therapy sessions with Emily Davis have been beneficial, but Avery finds it challenging to apply the strategies discussed. Adjustments to her medication regimen and additional therapy options may be necessary to address her current symptoms effectively.\n\nPlan:\n1. Adjust medication regimen as needed to address Avery's worsening symptoms.\n2. Explore additional therapy options, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, to help Avery manage negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n3. Develop a consistent routine incorporating self-care activities, relaxation techniques, and exercise to improve Avery's overall well-being.\n4. Discuss stress management strategies and coping mechanisms to address triggers contributing to Avery's anxiety and depression.\n5. Schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor Avery's progress and make any necessary adjustments to her treatment plan."

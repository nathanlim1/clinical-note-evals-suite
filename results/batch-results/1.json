  "note_text": "Subjective:\nMr. Pearson reports experiencing intermittent blurry vision, especially when reading or looking at objects far away. He denies double vision, eye pain, headaches, or recent head injuries/illnesses. He mentions a history of a cold a few weeks ago but states it did not affect his vision. Mr. Pearson works as a computer programmer and notes some eye strain due to prolonged screen time. He got new glasses a few months ago, which provided some relief.\n\nObjective:\nMr. Pearson presents with no signs of eye pain or double vision during the examination. His eyes appear normal without redness or discharge. Visual acuity is 20/20 with correction. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. No signs of eye muscle weakness or nystagmus. Fundoscopic exam reveals clear optic discs with sharp margins. No evidence of retinal abnormalities or hemorrhages.\n\nAssessment:\nMr. Pearson is experiencing intermittent blurry vision, likely related to eye strain from prolonged screen time as a computer programmer. No significant findings on physical examination to suggest underlying eye pathology. Referral to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management of his vision issues.\n\nPlan:\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist for a detailed assessment of Mr. Pearson's vision.\n2. Educate Mr. Pearson on eye exercises and proper screen ergonomics to reduce eye strain.\n3. Encourage regular breaks from screen time to rest his eyes.\n4. Follow up with the ophthalmologist's recommendations for further management.\n5. Schedule routine eye exams to monitor any changes in vision."

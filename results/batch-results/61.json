  "note_text": "Subjective:\nMr. Garza reports experiencing constant ear pain and difficulty hearing in his left ear for the past few days. He describes the pain as sharp and worsens when chewing or pressing on his ear. He denies any associated symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, or fever. Mr. Garza mentions having a cold a few weeks ago but states it did not affect his ears. He also notes a gradual decline in hearing in his left ear over the past few months.\n\nObjective:\nDuring the physical examination, Mr. Garza displayed tenderness upon palpation of the left ear. Otoscopic examination revealed redness and inflammation of the left tympanic membrane. No discharge or foul odor was noted. There was minimal earwax present. Tympanometry and hearing tests have been ordered to further evaluate his condition.\n\nAssessment:\nMr. Garza presents with acute otitis media in his left ear, characterized by inflammation of the tympanic membrane. This is likely contributing to his ear pain and hearing difficulties. His medical history of hypertension and diabetes may impact his overall health and treatment plan.\n\nPlan:\n1. Continue monitoring Mr. Garza's symptoms and response to treatment.\n2. Prescribe a course of antibiotics to address the infection.\n3. Recommend over-the-counter pain relievers for pain management.\n4. Schedule a follow-up appointment to assess treatment efficacy and conduct further tests if necessary.\n5. Educate Mr. Garza on ear care practices and preventive measures to avoid future ear infections."

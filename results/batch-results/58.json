Troy has been compliant with physical therapy exercises but notes only mild improvement in symptoms.\n\nObjective:\nTroy appears in no acute distress during the examination. He demonstrates limited range of motion in his lower back and reports tenderness upon palpation. No signs of numbness, weakness, or tingling sensations in his legs or feet are noted. Troy's vital signs are within normal limits, and he maintains good overall hygiene.\n\nAssessment:\nTroy presents with chronic back pain that has been ongoing for six months. Despite compliance with physical therapy exercises, he reports only minimal improvement in symptoms. Given his concern about following a similar path as his father, who underwent spinal fusion surgery, further evaluation by a spine specialist is recommended to discuss MRI results and explore alternative treatment options.\n\nPlan:\n1. Schedule an appointment with a spine specialist to review MRI results and discuss alternative treatment options.\n2. Renew prescription for acetaminophen to manage pain as needed.\n3. Recommend continued compliance with physical therapy exercises.\n4. Provide patient education on back pain management and self-care strategies.\n5. Follow up with Troy after his appointment with the spine specialist to adjust treatment plan as needed."

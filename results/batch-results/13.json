Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've had some nausea and vomiting, especially after eating. And I've been having some abdominal pain that comes and goes.\n\nPhysician: Okay, that's helpful. Can you tell me more about the abdominal pain? Is it sharp, dull, or crampy? Does it radiate anywhere?\n\nPatient: It's mostly a dull ache, but sometimes it's sharp. It doesn't seem to radiate anywhere, just a general discomfort in my belly.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you noticed any triggers that make your symptoms worse, such as certain foods or stress?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been avoiding spicy foods and citrus fruits because they seem to irritate my stomach. But other than that, I don't think there's anything specific that sets it off.\n\nPhysician: That's good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements lately?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I've had some diarrhea on and off. It's not constant, but it's definitely more frequent than usual.\n\nPhysician: Okay.

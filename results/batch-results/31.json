  "transcript_text": "\nPhysician: Good morning, Mrs. Lucas. Thank you for scheduling this appointment. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Good morning, Doctor. I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable, to be honest. I've been experiencing some vision problems lately, and it's been worrying me.\n\nPhysician: I see. Can you tell me more about your vision problems? What do you mean by \"vision problems\"?\n\nPatient: Well, it's mostly blurry vision, especially when I'm reading or watching TV. It's like there's a veil over my eyes, and I can't see things clearly. Sometimes, I also have trouble seeing colors, and everything appears faded.\n\nPhysician: Okay, that sounds like it could be a few different things. Have you experienced any eye pain, discomfort, or sensitivity to light?\n\nPatient: No, not really. Just the blurry vision and sometimes feeling like my eyes are tired.\n\nPhysician: All right. Have you had any recent changes in your environment or routine that could be contributing to your symptoms? For example, have you started a new medication or supplement, or have you been exposed to any chemicals or pollutants?\n\nPatient: I did start taking a new supplement for my joints a few months ago. It's called glucosamine. Could that be causing it?\n\nPhysician: It's possible. Glucosamine can sometimes cause eye irritation or blurry vision as a side effect. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like dry eyes or eye redness?\n\nPatient: Yes, my eyes have been feeling dry lately. And sometimes, they feel gritty, like there's sand in them.\n\nPhysician: I see. That's helpful information. Have you had any recent eye exams or vision tests?\n\nPatient: No, not recently. I had a vision test a few years ago, and my vision was fine back then.\n\nPhysician: Okay. In that case, I think it would be a good idea to schedule an eye exam with an ophthalmologist. They can perform a comprehensive eye exam to determine the cause of your vision problems and recommend appropriate treatment.\n\nPatient: That sounds good. I'm worried that it might be something serious.\n\nPhysician: We'll do our best to determine the cause and address it appropriately.

In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any further concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to my office.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor.

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nMrs. Lucas reports experiencing blurry vision, especially when reading or watching TV. She describes it as if there is a veil over her eyes and has trouble seeing colors clearly. She denies any eye pain, discomfort, or sensitivity to light but mentions feeling like her eyes are tired. Mrs. Lucas started taking a glucosamine supplement a few months ago and noticed dry eyes and a gritty sensation. She expresses concern about the seriousness of her symptoms.\n\nObjective:\nMrs. Lucas appears alert and oriented during the appointment. She does not display signs of eye redness or irritation. Her medical history includes hypertension, diabetes type II, osteoarthritis, and vision problems. Mrs. Lucas is due for an influenza vaccine and colorectal cancer screening. Her recent results show an HbA1c of 6.5% and blood pressure of 142/88 mmHg. An ophthalmologist appointment is scheduled for 3/15/2023 to address her vision problems.\n\nAssessment:\nMrs. Lucas presents with blurry vision, dry eyes, and a gritty sensation, possibly related to the glucosamine supplement she started taking. Given her symptoms and medical history, further evaluation by an ophthalmologist is warranted to determine the underlying cause of her vision problems. Mrs. Lucas is compliant with recommendations and expresses concerns about her eye health.\n\nPlan:\nThe physician will schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist for Mrs. Lucas to undergo a comprehensive eye exam. She is advised to discontinue the glucosamine supplement until further evaluation. Mrs. Lucas is encouraged to reach out if she experiences worsening symptoms or has additional concerns. Follow-up will be conducted to monitor her progress and address any further needs."

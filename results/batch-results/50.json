When did you first notice them, and how have they been affecting your daily life?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been feeling increasingly worried and on edge over the past few months. It's hard for me to fall asleep at night, and I find myself constantly thinking about work and other stressors.

Have you noticed any physical symptoms associated with your anxiety, such as a racing heart, trembling, or shortness of breath?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've experienced all of those symptoms, especially when I'm under a lot of stress. My heart races, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. It's pretty scary.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you tried any coping strategies or techniques to manage your anxiety?\n\nPatient: I've been trying to exercise more and practice meditation, but it's hard to find the time and motivation when I'm feeling so stressed out.\n\nPhysician: Those are great strategies, though.

  "note_text": "SOAP Note:\n\nSubjective:\nJean Elliott, a 59-year-old female, presents with symptoms of fever, chills, body aches, and fatigue for the past week. She reports a fever ranging from 101-102 degrees Fahrenheit and feeling weak and tired. Denies cough, sore throat, or congestion. No recent travel or exposure to sick individuals. Denies shortness of breath or chest pain. Reports taking Lisinopril, Metformin, and Atorvastatin for hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol, respectively. No significant recent stressors noted.\n\nObjective:\nPatient appears fatigued but alert during the examination. Vital signs show a temperature of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit. No signs of respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation. No abnormal heart sounds. Abdomen soft and non-tender. Patient's skin warm to touch. No rash or lesions noted. Patient's overall appearance consistent with flu-like symptoms.\n\nAssessment:\nBased on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, Jean Elliott likely has influenza.

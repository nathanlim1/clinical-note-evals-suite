  "note_text": "Subjective:\nKathy Morales, a 28-year-old female, presents with complaints of persistent joint pain in her wrists and knees for the past few months. She describes the pain as a dull ache that worsens in the mornings and after prolonged periods of sitting or standing. She denies any swelling, redness, fatigue, fever, or loss of appetite. The pain seems to be exacerbated by stress and inactivity. She has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen and acetaminophen with minimal relief.\n\nObjective:\nPhysical examination reveals no visible swelling or redness in the affected joints. Laboratory results show an elevated ESR and CRP. Joint aspiration was negative for crystals, and ANA was negative. Kathy's vital signs are within normal limits, and she appears well-groomed and in no acute distress.\n\nAssessment:\nBased on Kathy's symptoms, history, and lab results, there is a suspicion of an autoimmune disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in two weeks to reassess symptoms and discuss additional test results.\n\nPlan:\n1. Schedule follow-up appointment in two weeks for further evaluation.\n2. Consider additional testing to confirm the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.\n3. Discuss treatment options, including possible referral to a rheumatologist.\n4. Continue current medications (ibuprofen and acetaminophen) for pain management.\n5. Educate patient on the importance of staying active and managing stress to help alleviate symptoms."

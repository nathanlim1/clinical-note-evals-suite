But aside from that, no, nothing major.\n\nPhysician: Thanks for sharing that. Now, let's move on to your asthma.

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nCarolyn Cruz reports experiencing persistent headaches for the past three years, occurring about twice a week. She attributes the headaches to stress at work and notes sensitivity to light and sound. She has tried ibuprofen for relief but is concerned about the root cause of the headaches. Carolyn also mentions a decrease in appetite and trouble falling asleep recently.\n\nObjective:\nCarolyn appears alert and engaged during the conversation. She reports using her albuterol inhaler as needed for her well-controlled asthma, which has required more frequent use over the past year. No signs of acute distress are noted during the visit.\n\nAssessment:\nCarolyn presents with chronic tension-type headaches likely related to stress and muscle tension, without signs of neurological involvement. Her asthma is well-controlled with albuterol but may require closer monitoring due to increased usage. No concerning symptoms suggestive of a brain tumor are present.\n\nPlan:\nRecommend a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor Carolyn's headaches and asthma. Encourage continued use of ibuprofen for headache relief and appropriate use of the albuterol inhaler. Emphasize stress management techniques and healthy sleep habits to address headache triggers. Discuss the importance of regular monitoring and communication for ongoing symptom management."

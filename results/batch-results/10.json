Can you tell me more about your allergies and asthma?\n\nPatient: Sure, I've been experiencing some pretty bad allergy symptoms lately. I've been congested, sneezing, and my eyes have been itchy and watery. My asthma has also been acting up, I've been wheezing and coughing a lot, especially at night.\n\nPhysician: Okay, can you tell me more about your asthma symptoms? How often do you experience wheezing and coughing? Have you noticed any triggers that make your symptoms worse?\n\nPatient: My asthma symptoms have been pretty persistent lately. I'd say I experience wheezing and coughing at least a few times a week, sometimes more often. I've noticed that my symptoms tend to worsen when I'm exposed to dust and pollen, which is why I think my allergies are making my asthma worse.\n\nPhysician: That makes sense. Have you noticed any other triggers, such as exercise or stress? And have you been using your albuterol inhaler as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I've noticed that my symptoms can get worse when I'm stressed or when I exercise. I've been using my inhaler pretty regularly, but I feel like it's not working as well as it used to.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you had any recent upper respiratory infections or illnesses that could be exacerbating your symptoms?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. I had a pretty bad cold a few weeks ago that seemed to linger for a while. Could that be contributing to my symptoms?\n\nPhysician: Absolutely. A viral infection like a cold can definitely make your asthma and allergies worse. Let's talk about your allergies for a minute. Have you noticed any specific patterns or triggers that make your symptoms worse?\n\nPatient: Yeah, definitely. Like I said, I've been noticing that my symptoms tend to worsen when I'm exposed to dust and pollen.

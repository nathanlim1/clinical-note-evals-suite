  "note_text": "Subjective:\nAnita Armstrong reports experiencing severe headaches that have been increasing in frequency and severity over the past year. She describes the headaches as occurring on both sides of her head, sometimes daily or a few times a week. Anita notes feeling nauseous and dizzy at times, with no specific triggers identified. She has been taking ibuprofen for relief but has found it to be ineffective.\n\nObjective:\nAnita appears alert and engaged during the consultation. She reports no other symptoms associated with the headaches. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities.\n\nAssessment:\nAnita presents with chronic headaches that have been escalating in intensity and frequency. Further evaluation is warranted to determine the underlying cause. Differential diagnoses include tension headaches, migraines, or other potential neurological conditions. Blood work will be ordered to rule out underlying conditions, and a referral to a neurologist will be made for further assessment.\n\nPlan:\n1. Order blood work to investigate potential underlying conditions.\n2. Refer Anita to a neurologist for further evaluation and consultation.\n3. Increase ibuprofen dosage for improved symptom management.\n4. Consider other medications such as triptans or preventative medications if needed.\n5. Follow up with Anita to discuss test results and next steps in her treatment plan."

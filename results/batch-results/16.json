They're not too bad, but they're definitely noticeable.\n\nPhysician: Okay.

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nJulia Larson, a 34-year-old female, presents with complaints of chronic lower back pain that is constant and worsens with prolonged standing or walking. She also reports experiencing tingling sensations in her toes, heaviness in her legs, headaches at the back of her head, difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite, muscle spasms in her neck and shoulders, and fatigue. Julia attributes some of her symptoms to work-related stress and family issues. She has been using over-the-counter pain medication and engaging in stretching and exercise with minimal relief.\n\nObjective:\nJulia appears cooperative and compliant during the consultation. She displays no signs of acute distress. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the lower back region and limited range of motion. Neurological examination shows decreased sensation in the toes and reduced muscle strength in the lower extremities. Vital signs are within normal limits. Julia's medical history includes chronic pain management with Gabapentin and Tramadol.\n\nAssessment:\nJulia presents with chronic lower back pain with associated neurological symptoms, headaches, sleep disturbances, decreased appetite, and stress-related muscle spasms. Work-related stress and family issues contribute to her overall symptomatology. Further diagnostic tests are warranted to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms. Pain management strategies need to be optimized to improve Julia's quality of life and functionality.\n\nPlan:\nOrder diagnostic tests, including imaging studies and nerve conduction studies, to evaluate the source of Julia's chronic pain and neurological symptoms. Initiate a comprehensive pain management plan tailored to Julia's needs, which may include adjusting current medications, introducing new medications, and exploring non-pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy and stress management techniques. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor Julia's response to treatment and make necessary adjustments. Encourage open communication and collaboration to address Julia's holistic well-being."

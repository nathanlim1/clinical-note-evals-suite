  "note_text": "SOAP Note:\n\nSubjective:\nMrs. Mitchell reports experiencing worsening abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea over the past month. She describes the pain as a dull ache with occasional sharp stabbing pain, primarily located in the upper right side of her abdomen. She notes that fatty or spicy foods exacerbate the pain, along with prolonged periods of lying down. Mrs. Mitchell also mentions feeling tired, nauseous, and experiencing a persistent sour taste in her mouth. She reports irregular bowel movements, with periods of constipation followed by episodes of diarrhea. Additionally, she has lost approximately 10 pounds recently.\n\nObjective:\nMrs. Mitchell appears fatigued during the consultation but is alert and oriented. She denies any visible signs of distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. No signs of blood in stools or black tarry stools are noted. Mrs. Mitchell's weight has decreased by 10 pounds since her last visit.\n\nAssessment:\nMrs. Mitchell presents with chronic symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea, along with weight loss. Differential diagnoses include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), inflammatory bowel disease, or gastrointestinal infection. Further investigations are warranted to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.\n\nPlan:\n1. Order a colonoscopy to evaluate for colon polyps or cancer.\n2. Conduct a complete blood count (CBC) and lipid panel to assess for infections or inflammation.\n3. Perform an H. pylori antibody test to check for infection.\n4. Initiate treatment with omeprazole 20mg daily to alleviate symptoms.\n5. Advise Mrs. Mitchell to contact the clinic if she experiences worsening symptoms or has any concerns.\n6. Schedule a follow-up appointment to review test results and determine the next steps in her care plan."

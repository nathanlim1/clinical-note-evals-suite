I've had this constant urge to urinate, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to control. Sometimes, I feel like I'm going to wet myself.\n\nPhysician: I see. Can you tell me more about your urination habits? How often do you need to go, and are there any other symptoms you've noticed?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been going at least eight times a day, sometimes more. It's like my bladder can't hold anything anymore. And yes, there's this burning sensation when I pee, and sometimes blood in my urine. It's really worrying me.\n\nPhysician: I understand your concerns. Have you experienced any abdominal pain or discomfort in your lower back?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like that. Just a feeling of needing to go all the time. And sometimes, I feel like I can't fully empty my bladder.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?\n\nPatient: Yes, Doctor. My bowel movements have become more frequent and loose. It's like my body can't decide what it wants to do.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you had any recent falls or injuries?\n\nPatient: (nervously) Yes, Doctor. I've had a few falls recently. My son's been worried sick about me.\n\nPhysician: I'm not surprised. We'll need to address that. Have you experienced any memory issues or confusion?\n\nPatient: (hesitantly) Yes...I've been forgetting things, like where I put my keys or what I was supposed to do. It's like my mind just goes blank.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as dizziness, nausea, or headaches?\n\nPatient: (thoughtfully) Now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit dizzy and lightheaded. And sometimes, I get this weird taste in my mouth, like metal or something.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Mrs. Marshall, based on what you've shared, we need to run some tests to rule out a few things.

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nAnita Fowler reports experiencing persistent back pain since November of last year. She describes the pain as a dull ache in her lower back that worsens with prolonged standing or walking. She denies any weakness, numbness, or tingling in her legs or feet. Anita has been taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen for pain relief, with minimal improvement. She attributes the onset of pain to her sedentary job, which involves prolonged sitting at a desk.\n\nObjective:\nDuring the examination, Anita appeared comfortable but exhibited signs of discomfort when asked to perform certain movements. There were no visible signs of injury or abnormalities on inspection. Vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the lumbar region upon palpation. Range of motion in the lumbar spine was limited, particularly with forward bending.\n\nAssessment:\nAnita Fowler presents with chronic back pain of unknown etiology, likely exacerbated by prolonged sitting at her desk job. The pain management specialist referral is warranted to further evaluate and manage her condition. Muscle relaxants may provide additional relief, and a follow-up appointment in two weeks will allow for monitoring of her progress.\n\nPlan:\n1. Refer Anita to a pain management specialist for further evaluation and treatment.\n2. Prescribe a muscle relaxant to help alleviate back pain.\n3. Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess response to treatment and make any necessary adjustments.\n4. Advise Anita to incorporate regular breaks and gentle stretching exercises into her daily routine to alleviate back pain associated with prolonged sitting.\n5. Educate Anita on proper ergonomics and posture to prevent exacerbation of back pain at work."

Just the fatigue and brain fog, and the heavy legs.\n\nPhysician: Okay. Have you been under any significant stress recently? Work-related or personal stress?\n\nPatient: Well, I did have a bit of a rough patch at work a few months ago. But it's all good now. I don't think that's what's causing this.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you had any recent travel or exposure to illness?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty much staying close to home.\n\nPhysician: Alright. I'm going to order some additional blood work to check your thyroid function, as well as your blood sugar and lipid levels. We'll also schedule you for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to review the results and discuss any necessary changes to your medications or lifestyle. In the meantime, I recommend that you start exercising regularly. Even a short walk each day can make a big difference in your energy levels and overall health. And we'll also set you up with a dietitian consult to help you develop healthier eating habits. Sound good?\n\nPatient: Sounds great, Dr. Matthews. Thank you. I really appreciate your help.\n\nPhysician: You're welcome, Mr. Mitchell. We'll work together to get you feeling better in no time.",

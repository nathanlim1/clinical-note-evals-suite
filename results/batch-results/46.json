  "note_text": "Subjective:\nSteve Andrews, a 79-year-old male, presented with concerns regarding difficulty with urination, including hesitancy, incomplete emptying, and discomfort. He also reported increased urinary frequency and urgency, especially at night. Additionally, Steve mentioned experiencing erectile dysfunction and a decrease in libido without pain during sexual activity.\n\nObjective:\nDuring the examination, Steve appeared alert and oriented. Vital signs were within normal limits. No signs of distress were noted. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Lab tests were ordered to assess kidney function and rule out infections.\n\nAssessment:\nSteve presents with symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia, including urinary hesitancy, incomplete emptying, and discomfort. His erectile dysfunction and decreased libido may be related to underlying urological issues. Referral to a urologist for further evaluation is recommended.\n\nPlan:\n1. Update medication list and order lab tests to assess kidney function.\n2. Refer Steve to a urologist for further evaluation of urinary symptoms and sexual health concerns.\n3. Follow up with Steve after urology consultation to discuss treatment options and management plan."

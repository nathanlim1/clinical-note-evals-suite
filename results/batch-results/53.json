Just the fatigue and joint pain.\n\nPhysician: Alright. I also noticed that your lipid panel results showed borderline high cholesterol levels. Have you had any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?\n\nPatient: Yes, my mother had high cholesterol, and my father had a heart attack when he was in his 60s.\n\nPhysician: I see.

  "note_text": "SOAP Note:\n\nSubjective:\nCarrie Griffin, a 67-year-old female, presents with complaints of fatigue that comes and goes, joint pain primarily in the knees and hips, and feeling down or irritable despite thyroid medication. She reports no swelling, redness, fever, or loss of appetite. Family history includes high cholesterol and heart disease.\n\nObjective:\nCarrie appears fatigued during the appointment but is alert and oriented. She exhibits discomfort when moving her knees and hips but denies any swelling or redness. No other abnormalities noted during the physical examination. Recent lipid panel shows borderline high cholesterol levels.\n\nAssessment:\nCarrie presents with symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, and possible thyroid medication inefficacy. Family history of high cholesterol and heart disease increases her risk factors. Osteoarthritis is limiting her daily activities and causing pain.\n\nPlan:\n1. Adjust thyroid medication dosage or consider alternative medication.\n2. Monitor cholesterol levels and consider starting a statin.\n3. Discuss treatment options for osteoarthritis, including medication or physical therapy.\n4. Schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor thyroid and cholesterol levels.\n5. Educate patient on lifestyle modifications to manage cholesterol levels and joint pain.\n6. Nurse to room patient for further instructions and scheduling."

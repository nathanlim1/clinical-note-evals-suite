  "transcript_text": "\nPhysician: Good morning, Mrs. Stanley. It's a pleasure to meet you. I understand you've been experiencing some concerning symptoms lately. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?\n\nPatient: Yes, doctor. For the past few days, I've been feeling really short of breath, even when I'm just sitting still. And when I cough, it's been producing a lot of mucus. It's been getting worse every day.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as chest pain or tightness?\n\nPatient: No, no chest pain. But sometimes, I feel like I'm going to pass out because of the shortness of breath. And my energy levels have been really low lately. I've also had a bit of a sore throat.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you had any recent travel or been exposed to anyone with similar symptoms?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't traveled anywhere recently. And as far as I know, no one in my family or friends has been sick.\n\nPhysician: That's good to know. Let's talk about your medical history. You have hypertension and diabetes. Are you taking your medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I take my lisinopril and metformin every day. And I've been using my albuterol inhaler more often because of the shortness of breath.\n\nPhysician: Great. Have you noticed any issues with your medications, such as side effects or difficulty taking them?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't had any problems with the medications. But I have been a bit forgetful lately. My son has been helping me remember to take them.\n\nPhysician: That's helpful. I'm glad to hear that. Have you had any recent changes in your diet or appetite?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been feeling a bit nauseous lately, especially in the mornings. And I've lost a little weight because I haven't been eating as much.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, or fatigue?\n\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I've been feeling really tired and weak, even after resting. And sometimes, I feel like I'm shaking or trembling inside.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?\n\nPatient: No, I haven't noticed any swelling. But my son has been telling me that my energy levels have been really low lately.\n\nPhysician: I see. Mrs. Stanley, based on what you've shared with me today, it sounds like you might have a respiratory infection, possibly pneumonia. We'll need to run some tests to confirm that. In the meantime, I'd like to prescribe you an antibiotic to help manage your symptoms. I'll also order a chest X-ray and some blood work to help us better understand what's going on. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I appreciate your help. I just want to feel better.\n\nPhysician: Of course, Mrs. Stanley. We'll do everything we can to help you feel better. I'll have my nurse come in to take your vital signs and go over the medication instructions with you. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to check on your progress. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or ask me before we wrap up today's visit?\n\nPatient: No, doctor. I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.\n\nPhysician: You're welcome, Mrs. Stanley. We'll take good care of you.",

I've been having these headaches that just won't go away. They've been getting worse over the past year, and it's really affecting my daily life.\n\nPhysician: I see. Can you describe the headaches for me? What does the pain feel like? Is it constant or does it come and go?\n\nCharlotte: The pain is throbbing, like someone is squeezing my head on both sides. It's not constant, but it can last for 4-6 hours at a time. It's really frustrating because I can't seem to do anything to make it go away.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you noticed any triggers that seem to set off the headaches? Maybe certain foods, stress, or lack of sleep?\n\nCharlotte: Well, I have been under a lot of stress at work lately.

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nCharlotte Thompson, a 52-year-old female, presents with chronic headaches that have been worsening over the past year. She reports experiencing throbbing pain on both sides of her head, lasting 4-6 hours, with an average of 3-4 headaches per week. She notes that stress at work and lack of sleep may exacerbate the headaches. Charlotte has tried ibuprofen with limited relief and has increased her coffee intake recently.\n\nObjective:\nDuring the clinical encounter, Charlotte appeared alert and engaged. She did not exhibit signs of distress or discomfort. Vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination did not reveal any focal neurological deficits.

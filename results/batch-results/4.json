Is it just blurry vision, or are there any other symptoms like double vision or eye strain?\n\nPatient: It's mostly blurry vision, but I do get some headaches occasionally. They're not too severe, but they're definitely noticeable.\n\nPhysician: Okay. Have you noticed any differences in your vision between distance and near objects? For example, do you have trouble seeing things far away or up close?\n\nPatient: It's mostly my near vision that's affected. I have trouble reading texts and emails, and I've been having to hold books and documents closer to my face to see them clearly.\n\nPhysician: I understand.

For example, have you started a new job or changed your work schedule?\n\nPatient: Well, I did start a new job a few months ago, and I've been working longer hours. Could that be a factor?\n\nPhysician: It's possible. Longer work hours could potentially lead to eye strain.

  "transcript_text": "\nPhysician: Good morning, Valerie. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, Dr. Kuhn. I've been feeling pretty miserable lately. I've had a constant runny nose, watery eyes, and sneezing nonstop. It's like my allergies are going crazy!\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to make your symptoms worse?\n\nPatient: Well, it seems to get worse when I'm outside, especially in the mornings and evenings. And when I'm around dust or pollen, my symptoms seem to flare up.\n\nPhysician: Okay, that's helpful. How have you been managing your symptoms so far? Have you been using any medications or treatments?\n\nPatient: I've been using Flonase and Singulair, like Dr. Dove recommended. But to be honest, I haven't been taking them as consistently as I should. And sometimes, I feel like they're not working as well as they should be.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you noticed any shortness of breath or chest tightness, along with your nasal symptoms?\n\nPatient: Yes, definitely. Especially when I exert myself or exercise, I start to feel like I can't catch my breath. And sometimes, I get this tightness in my chest that feels like someone is squeezing it.\n\nPhysician: That's concerning. Have you experienced any wheezing or coughing?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I've had some wheezing, especially when I breathe out. And I've had a persistent cough, mostly at night or in the morning.\n\nPhysician: Okay, that sounds like your asthma might be flaring up. Have you had any recent colds or viruses that could be exacerbating your symptoms?\n\nPatient: Actually, yes. I had a cold about a week ago, and it seemed to trigger all of this. But even after the cold subsided, my symptoms didn't really go away.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like fatigue or fever?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like that. Just a lot of congestion and coughing.\n\nPhysician: Alright, Valerie. Based on what you've shared, it sounds like your allergies and asthma are definitely causing some problems for you.

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nValerie reports feeling miserable lately with constant runny nose, watery eyes, and nonstop sneezing. Symptoms worsen outdoors, especially in the mornings and evenings, around dust and pollen. She admits to inconsistent use of Flonase and Singulair, with perceived lack of efficacy. Shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing, and coughing present, exacerbated by recent cold. No fever or fatigue reported.\n\nObjective:\nValerie presents with nasal congestion, coughing, and wheezing. Lung function assessment needed for asthma control evaluation. Medications include Flonase, Singulair, Serevent, ProAir HFA, and Montelukast. Allergies to pollen, dust mites, mold, peanuts, shellfish, eggs, penicillin, and ibuprofen noted. Family history of allergies and asthma.\n\nAssessment:\nValerie's allergies and asthma are causing significant symptoms, with poor medication adherence contributing to inadequate control. Asthma exacerbation likely triggered by recent cold. Adjustment of Flonase dosage, addition of antihistamine, and evaluation of lung function recommended. Follow-up appointment with pulmonologist scheduled for further assessment and potential medication adjustments.\n\nPlan:\n1. Increase Flonase dosage to twice daily and consider adding antihistamine.\n2. Schedule follow-up appointment with pulmonologist for asthma evaluation.\n3. Use Albuterol inhaler every 4-6 hours as needed and consider adding Prednisone.\n4. Schedule mammography and pap smear appointments.\n5. Schedule follow-up appointment in a few weeks to reassess symptoms and medications."

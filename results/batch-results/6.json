  "transcript_text": "\nPhysician: Good morning, Dolores. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi, Dr. Butler. I've been doing a bit better lately, but I still have some days where my pain is pretty intense.\n\nPhysician: I see. Can you tell me more about your pain? What's the intensity like on a scale of one to ten?\n\nPatient: It's usually around a six or seven, but it can spike to a nine or ten when I overdo it.\n\nPhysician: And what activities trigger these flare-ups?\n\nPatient: Mainly bending or twisting, like when I'm cooking or trying to pick up something heavy.\n\nPhysician: I understand. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or tingling in your limbs?\n\nPatient: Yes, sometimes my legs feel weak, and I get a tingling sensation in my feet.\n\nPhysician: Okay. Have you experienced any recent weight gain or loss?\n\nPatient: A little bit of weight gain, maybe five pounds or so.\n\nPhysician: And how's your sleep been? Do you have trouble falling or staying asleep?\n\nPatient: I've been having trouble falling asleep lately. I'll lie awake for a bit, feeling restless.\n\nPhysician: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels?\n\nPatient: Yes, I've been feeling a bit down and fatigued, especially when my pain is worse.\n\nPhysician: Dolores, I'm going to examine your joints and muscles now. Can you please stand up and walk around the room for me?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nPhysician: (After observing Dolores's movements) I notice you have a bit of a limp and some stiffness in your gait. Can you tell me more about your physical therapy regimen?\n\nPatient: I've been seeing a physical therapist, Mr. Dunn, twice a week. We've been working on exercises to strengthen my core and legs, as well as some stretching.\n\nPhysician: That's great. Have you noticed any improvements since starting physical therapy?\n\nPatient: Yes, definitely. My balance has improved, and I can walk a bit further without getting tired.\n\nPhysician: Excellent. What about your pain medication? Have you experienced any side effects or concerns?\n\nPatient: No, not really. I've been taking them as directed, and they seem to be helping.\n\nPhysician: I'm glad to hear that. Dolores, based on what you've shared with me today, it sounds like we're on the right track with your treatment plan. Let's continue with the physical therapy and pain management strategy for now. I'll also order some additional blood work to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nPatient: Sounds good to me. Thank you, Dr. Butler.\n\nPhysician: Of course, Dolores. We'll monitor your progress and adjust your plan as needed. I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a few weeks.",

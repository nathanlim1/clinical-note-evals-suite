Thank you, Doctor.\n\nPhysician: Of course, Mr. Fields. We'll have our team schedule an appointment for the eye exam and get back to you with the results. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.",
  "note_text": "Subjective:\nMr. Fields reports experiencing gradual worsening of his vision over the past few months. He notes difficulty reading objects up close, leading to holding items farther away for clarity. He also mentions experiencing headaches more frequently. Blurry vision, double vision, eye dryness, and discomfort are additional symptoms he has noticed. Mr. Fields attributes increased screen time as a potential factor contributing to his vision issues.\n\nObjective:\nDuring the examination, Mr. Fields displayed signs of eye strain and discomfort. Pupil response was within normal limits, and visual acuity testing revealed difficulty in reading small print up close. No signs of infection or inflammation were noted. Blood sugar levels were within the normal range.\n\nAssessment:\nMr. Fields presents with symptoms suggestive of presbyopia and digital eye strain. These symptoms may be exacerbated by prolonged screen time and age-related changes in vision. No signs of diabetic retinopathy or other serious eye conditions were observed during the examination.\n\nPlan:\nA comprehensive eye exam will be scheduled to further evaluate Mr. Fields' vision and determine the appropriate prescription for reading glasses. Recommendations for reducing eye strain, such as taking regular breaks from screen time and adjusting display settings, will be provided. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor Mr. Fields' progress and address any ongoing concerns."

  "note_text": "Subjective:\nMr. Spencer reports feeling off lately with symptoms of shortness of breath and low energy levels. He describes the shortness of breath as intermittent and noticeable during simple tasks like walking upstairs. He denies chest pain or tightness but acknowledges feeling tired most of the time, even after adequate sleep. He denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea. Mr. Spencer notes higher blood sugar levels and increasing blood pressure. He also mentions joint pain, particularly in the mornings.\n\nObjective:\nMr. Spencer appears fatigued during the examination but is alert and oriented. Vital signs show blood pressure at 142/88 mmHg. Lab results indicate an HbA1c of 6.8% and a normal lipid panel. Physical examination reveals signs of osteoarthritis with joint tenderness and limited range of motion.\n\nAssessment:\nMr. Spencer presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, elevated blood sugar, and increasing blood pressure. His osteoarthritis is contributing to joint pain. Lab results show stable diabetes control but elevated blood pressure. Further evaluation is needed to assess kidney function and digestive health through a colonoscopy.\n\nPlan:\nOrder lab tests to monitor blood sugar control, blood pressure, lipid panel, and kidney function. Schedule a colonoscopy for further evaluation. Increase blood pressure medication to manage hypertension. Recommend lifestyle changes to improve symptoms. Follow up with Mr. Spencer to discuss test results and adjust treatment plan as needed."
